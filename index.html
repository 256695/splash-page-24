         A little bit more about my personal life is that i am originally Serbian and live in a family of 5 memebers with my parents and two sisters. In my free time I like to hang out with my family and frineds, play grass or sand volleyball, listen to music, read, and watch movies. My favorite color is red and my favorite food is pasta.
